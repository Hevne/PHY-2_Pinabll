# Physics 2 CITM'S Videogames design & development Degree

We are two students from CITM'S videogames degree, in this case we were asked to code a simple pinball in C++ using BOX2D libraries<br>
and taking reference from an existing one. In this case:<br> Full-Power Pinball || Hot Wheels : https://play.hotwheels.com/en-us/games/full-power-pinball.html <br> <br>

Some of the software we used for this assignment is: SFW Decompiler, Visual Studio, Flash Downloader and SDL & BOX2d libraries.<br>

## Controls

* 'Z' & 'M' for controlling left/right bumpers
* 'Down Arrow' for pulling the plunger
* 'F1' to activate debug mode and seeing chains/boxes/circles/sensors...
* 'Click' on the ball while in debug mode lets u drag it through the map
* 'ESC' for closing the exe

## Differences between original

Beyond the differences about numbers in code the only feature we couldn't be in time to implement was 
the one where after hitting 5 fences on the left side of the bumpers, a wheel starts spinning and the player unlocks the door to some kind
of slider and an animation where car rides through it pops up.
